#### What/How/Why
ScWPSetup does all the work for you when setting up a new WordPress project with [Scotch Box](https://box.scotch.io/). Simply add your preferred theme, plugins, options etc. into `config.yml` and your good to go. With ScWPSetup it won't take you no longer than 5 minutes until you can start working on your new WordPress project.
Executing setup.sh then will
- download/install/configure WordPress
- set WordPress options
- install/activate your favorite WordPress theme (default [WPSeed](https://wpseed.org)).
- install/activate the plugins you defined in the config
- clean WordPress defaults (contents, plugins, themes, unused files)

***You're able to adjust wich of the above tasks will be executed. Simply set the desired tasks to true/false in the "Setup Options" section at the bottom of  `config.yml`***

Now you can use your `config.yml` as a template for every new project and save a lot of time clicking, dragging, editing and configuring.

See this [Screenshot](http://flurinduerst.ch/web/ScWPSetup/setup_screenshot.png) for a preview of how the setup will look like.

#### Dependencies
- ssh access to your VM/host
- [wp cli](https://wp-cli.org/) 0.23+ on your VM/host

ScWPSetup is made to work with [Scotch Box](https://box.scotch.io/). Since `ScWPSetup Version 1.3.1+` you can edit the WordPress root folder so you should be able to run with any other vagrantbox or webhost (see [ScWPSetup when not using Sotch Box](https://github.com/flurinduerst/ScWPSetup#setup-when-not-using-scotch-box)).
